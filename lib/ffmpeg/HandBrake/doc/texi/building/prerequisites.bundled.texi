@quotation Note
It is recommended to use the platform distribution's standard compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime requirements and have new/delete, exception and RTTI incompatibilities. There are of course many valid reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware it is generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader.
